# Licence-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
Steps: 
1. Get_numberPLTfromTxt.ipynb  is the major file for running Streamlit app, run last two lines only 
2. v2.py contains ANPR model code
3. retriveUsers.py is to send request to the owner from Email
4. CrossVarXregister-Copy2 is major streamlit app
5. Create FireBase database (empty) and replace its auth ids
6. Replace the email id and pass in the retriveUsers.py with yours and create app password for the email
7. requirements.txt has all the requirements

Rest of the files are yet to be sorted as useful and garbage at the end of this project! 

FireBase is used for backend.
